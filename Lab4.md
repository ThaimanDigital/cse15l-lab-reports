# Lab 4

The following tasks were run using the [lab 7](https://github.com/ThaimanDigital/lab7) repository, which I had previously forked onto my Github account. I had also previously set up keys on my computer to automatically log into my ieng6 and github accounts.

## Step 1: Log into ieng6

The first step is to log into my course-specific ieng6 account, which i did by typing `$ cs15lwi23akp@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into my terminal. Note that I had already generated SSH keys to log into my ieng6 account automatically. 

Keys pressed: `cs15lwi23akp@ieng6.ucsd.edu, <enter>`

## Step 2: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

The next step is to clone the lab7 repository onto your computer by using the `git clone` command. I also already had the ssh link copied to my clipboard which allowed me to simply paste the link instead of typing it out. I am also using a mac and use mac commands for copy and paste.

Keys pressed: `git clone, <Command> + v, <enter>`

## Step 3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

In order to run the tests, I first have to change the directory into lab7 with `$ cd lab7/`. Instead of typing out lab7, I used tab to autocomplete my command.

Keys pressed: `cd l, <tab>, <enter>`

## Step 4: Edit the code file to fix the failing test



## Step 5: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
## Ste 6: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
